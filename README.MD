# ScheduleApp
Fun C# project created by sh0ckR6 to get better with [ppy/osu-framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework).

## Install
When a new release is available, you can download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/sh0ckR6/ScheduleApp/releases/latest). I'm too lazy to implement Squirrel into this project, so you'll have to manually update.
